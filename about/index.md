Hello there! Nice to meet you. I have been known online as the alias of Blaher. Please, feel free to call me by Ben. Homosapien extraordinaire. CTO, investor, day trader, affiliate marketer, senior software engineer, macroeconomist, biological chemist, physicist, mathematician, analyst, philosopher, polymath, utilitarian, father, tennis player, dog whisper, human meat popsicle, or mad man; feel free to call me whatever. My family roots itself in Stark County, OH. As a direct descendant of one of the first settlers of Stark County, I’ve made it my home too. Growing up in the countryside, I have moved back in to civilization. I was raised by two loving parents, a construction worker, and a secretary. Entrepreneurship and intelligence have run heavy in my family's blood though, as it does in mine as well.
